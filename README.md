# Hamming-Code
Hamming Code Generator and Error Detection Program
This project implements a simple Hamming Code Generator and Error Detection system in C. The program takes a binary data word from the user, calculates the Hamming code with the necessary parity bits, and checks for errors in a received code word. It provides an efficient method to detect single-bit errors.
